        <p>As may the word "paid" sound , people weren't really ready to trust a group with their money , and there's no shame in the fact that we had only 15 players in all total! Yet the prize pool did not come down , even by a penny! </p>

        <p>Anticipation was sky high , the final showdown was yet to come. Just when we thought our tournament was in the verge of failure, we got 15 squad entries ! Which began an ultimate showdown, to be known as the best squad. The underdogs created history while everyone else was expecting Hitzzu to clean sweep!

        <p>Due to lack of time Duo was shifted to the next day , and we witnessed something magical , although ALL BLACK stood #2 in match, due to low kills lost to BHS' kill spree. While BCsquad wrecked havoc.
